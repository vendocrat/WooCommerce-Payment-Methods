Easily display your accepted payment methods from WooCommerce via shortcode, widget or template tag.

== Description ==

WooCommerce Payment Methods allows you to display your accepted payment methods. By default the plugin shows all available payment methods, but you can also specify them manually.

You can display them via shortcode, widget or template tag in three available styles (default, inverse and outline). We've added several classes, so you can easily style the output to your pleasure.

You are using the famous Bootstrap framework? Awesome, cause we've added the markup for tooltips, so that users can see the payment methods name on hover.

All icons are displayed using the truly awesome icon font <a href="https://github.com/orlandotm/payment-webfont">Payment Webfont</a> by @orlandotm, making them look good on every screen.

Contributions are warmly welcome via <a href="https://github.com/vendocrat/WooComerce-Payment-Methods"><strong>GitHub</strong></a>.
